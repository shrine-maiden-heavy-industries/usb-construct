        If using the development branch, then you can use the following command to get
        the specific version you're on:


        `python -c 'import usb_construct;print(usb_construct.__version__)'`
      placeholder: 'e.g. v1.0.5'

        If the problem occurs on one or more specific operating systems select all as appropriate.


        Please note, we have limited testing on less common systems such as things like Plan9, Haiku,
        illumos-based systems, or most BSDs, so an issue occurring on one of those platforms will take
        longer to diagnose.
      options:
        - 'Linux'
        - 'BSD'
        - 'illumos'
        - 'Solaris'
        - 'macOS'
        - 'Windows'
        - 'Other'
      multiple: true

        If more than one operating system and/or version, please list them all separated
        by a comma.

        When providing steps to reproduce the issue, please ensure that the issue
        is reproducible in the latest development revision of USB Construct. Also, ensure to
        provide all necessary source files needed if possible.


        Please see [https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve)
        for information on how to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable Example
        (MCVE).


        However, we know this is not always possible, and things can be hard to minify, so if you
        cant fully that is fine, it just might take a bit longer to diagnose the issue.
